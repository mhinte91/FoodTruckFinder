# Full Feature Application Pitch

By using React and the MERN stack, I would convert this proof-of-concept app into an intuitive, user-friendly single-page-application. Making use of a database would allow users to register an account, and keep track of their favorite food trucks.

Using the Google Maps API, location data from the Food Truck API would be displayed visually on an interactive map, and a search function would be implemented to allow users to filter results by either business name or location.

Each food truck would have its own business page, including pictures and/or information organized in an easy-to-read format. From this page, users may access all avaliable information available from the API, or add the business to a preferred list.

A user's preferred list would display on their homepage, with only the most important information (name, open/closed) being displayed.
